Toki Pona Dictionary in pictures. It has translations of 123 Toki Pona’s words to English, Italian and Russian.

## Why
First, we wanted to know how it’s easy to learn other language having bridge via pictures and famous syntactic language. 

As an extra constrain we have chosen not to use any symbols or signs in modern culture as much as it possible.

Second, it was fun to see some stories with pictures we made.
